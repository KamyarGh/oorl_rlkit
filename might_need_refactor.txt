- gen_meta_irl_expert_trajs.py
    - assuming the policy was trained with rl so it has an exploration policy
- init for envs
- policy can't simultaneously use pixels and non-pixel inputs
- make a subclass of gym Env for a meta env and make it so that it has to have things
    like iterators etc. and move every constraint in there
- working with both task_identifiers and task_params and obs_task_params is unintuitive and messy, fix it
